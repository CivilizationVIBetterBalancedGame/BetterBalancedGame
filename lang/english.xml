			<Text>During the Peloponnesian War, one hundred sieges were attempted and fifty-eight ended with the surrender of the besieged area.[NEWLINE]Alexander the Great's army successfully besieged many powerful cities during his conquests. Two of his most impressive achievements in siegecraft took place in the Siege of Tyre and the Siege of the Sogdian Rock. His engineers built a causeway that was originally 60 m (200 ft) wide and reached the range of his torsion-powered artillery, while his soldiers pushed siege towers housing stone throwers and light catapults to bombard the city walls.[NEWLINE]Most conquerors before him had found Tyre, a Phoenician island-city about 1 km from the mainland, impregnable. The Macedonians built a mole, a raised spit of earth across the water, by piling stones up on a natural land bridge that extended underwater to the island, and although the Tyrians rallied by sending a fire ship to destroy the towers, and captured the mole in a swarming frenzy, the city eventually fell to the Macedonians after a seven-month siege. In complete contrast to Tyre, Sogdian Rock was captured by stealthy attack. Alexander used commando-like tactics to scale the cliffs and capture the high ground, and the demoralized defenders surrendered.</Text>

			<Text>According to the story, around the year 1189 Iron Li developed a new method for hunting foxes which used a ceramic explosive to scare foxes into his nets. The explosive consisted of a ceramic bottle with a mouth, stuffed with gunpowder, and attached with a fuse. Explosive and net were placed at strategic points of places such as watering holes frequented by foxes, and when they got near enough, Iron Li would light the fuse, causing the ceramic bottle to explode and scaring the frightened foxes right into his nets.[NEWLINE]While a fanciful tale, it's not exactly certain why this would cause the development of the iron bomb, given the explosive was made using ceramics, and other materials such as bamboo or even leather would have done the same job, assuming they made a loud enough noise. Nonetheless, the iron bomb made its first appearance in 1221 at the siege of Qizhou (in modern Hubei province), and this time it would be the Jin who possessed the technological advantage. The Song commander Zhao Yurong survived and was able to relay his account for posterity.</Text>

			<Text>Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines largely comprising military trenches, in which troops are well-protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. Trench warfare became archetypically associated with the World War I (1914–1918), when the Race to the Sea rapidly expanded trench use on the Western Front starting in September 1914.[NEWLINE]Trench warfare proliferated when a revolution in firepower was not matched by similar advances in mobility, resulting in a gruelling form of warfare in which the defender held the advantage. On the Western Front in 1914–1918, both sides constructed elaborate trench, underground, and dugout systems opposing each other along a front, protected from assault by barbed wire. The area between opposing trench lines (known as "no man's land") was fully exposed to artillery fire from both sides. Attacks, even if successful, often sustained severe casualties. </Text>

In Civilization VI we simulate this with the Flanking and Support bonuses. Once a player has completed the Military Tradition civic, their military is considered advanced enough in order to benefit from these bonuses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Flanking: If an enemy melee unit is surrounded by 2 or more adjacent friendly melee units during an attack, it is considered flanked, granting a +2 combat bonus to the melee attacker for each additional flanking melee unit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Support: When defending against an enemy melee attack, a defending unit ([COLOR_RED]except land ranged and naval ranged - Better Balanced Game[ENDCOLOR]) can gain a +2 combat bonus for every adjacent friendly unit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Air and anti-air units gain combat strength for each adjacent unit. It is similar to support combat bonus, but they do not need Military Tradition civic to get this bonus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Air units gain +5 combat bonus for every adjacent deployed air unit when defending.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Anti-air units gain +5 combat bonus for every adjacent unit that has anti-air ability.</Text>
